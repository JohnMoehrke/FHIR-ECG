# FHIR-ECG
ECG Model for FHIR based on IEEE 11073

This was made November 2015, so it would need to be modified to fit current FHIR build

This is provided as-is. It is just my view on how the IEEE model overlays into a FHIR Resource. 

Comments and suggestions welcome, but they really should be directed toward the formal creation of this kind of a resource in FHIR where further refinement can be made.
